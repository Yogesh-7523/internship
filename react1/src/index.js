/*
The code above is the entry point for a React application.

The code imports the React and ReactDOM libraries to render the App component to the DOM.

The ReactDOM.createRoot function is used to create a root element for the React app. This is the recommended way to render a React app in newer versions of React.

The root element is used to render the App component inside a React.StrictMode element, which is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application.

The code also calls the reportWebVitals function, which is a utility function for measuring the performance of the app.

Overall, this code sets up the React app and renders the App component to the DOM. It also includes tools for measuring and improving the performance of the app.
